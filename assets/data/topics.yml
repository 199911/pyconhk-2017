          High Available Database Architecture is so important.  It is more than
          just the HA but also scalable design to the demand.   MySQL Group
          Replication is one of the key features in MySQL 5.7 (since the
          release of 5.7.17).   The session will share the setup of MySQL Group
          Replication together with the MySQL InnoDB Cluster, in which the MySQL
          Shell, MySQL Router + MySQL Group Replication architecture go together
          to form a scalable and reliable db infrastructure to your
          application(s).

          In this session learn about the new features in MySQL 8.0 Development
          Milestone Release, including the new transactional data dictionary,
          SQL roles, new character sets and collations, and much more.

          Ubiquitous physical computing is here, blurring what is digital and
          real in our daily experience. Join me for an interactive tour of how
          to create digital+physical experiences on the web with IoT, AR, VR
          and other emerging technologies.

          Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for
          malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary
          (or "compiled") packages to end users.

        - >
          The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification
          that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by
          promising identical binary packages are always generated from a
          given source.

        - >
          This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware
          on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously
          infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.

        - >
          This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be
          reproducible, the tools, tests & specifications we have written to
          fix & diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in
          upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition,
          you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the
          future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.

          This topic is about  Open CV in Raspberry PI 3 with Camera. I would
          like to explain about this module how to install and use , and show
          some demo from  the standard of the point of the view in performance
          for making robots like an eye's function we can use.

          We will show you some tips about how to setup OpenStack platform, and
          bring you our experience in setting up private cloud for commercial
          use, with hints on consideration of architecture, HA and network
          design.

          Usually we have to choose between performance, safety, and development
          speed. We have C/C++, Java, and bunch of scripting languages.

          modern syntax and examples of concurrency approach.

          This talk discusses about my experience in working on Rux
          (https://github.com/sorpaas/rux), a hobbist microkernel project in
          Rust. It is nearly complete and features a capability-based system
          similar to seL4. More will be focused on how to roll out your own
          kernel project based on Rux.

          General Description
        - >
          Rust is great for building mathematical models and AI which is the
          talk of the hour and a great emerging domain is based on mathematics
          which can crunch realtime data to provide human level insights which
          helps in making logical decisions.
        - >
          There are already many crates in rust which provide AI units which
          help in implementing deep learning and reinforcement learning systems
          and algorithms.
        - >
          Proposals basically deep dives into such implementations in rust and
          covers the benchmarks of performance of the rust crates with the
          industrial grade libraries such as tensor flow and caffe. The Talk
          touches upon the major problems in the industrial grade libraries and
          how rust can help in avoiding them.
        - >
          Demos of few mathematical models to perform prediction tasks and how
          to start off development of models from scratch in rust will be
          demonstrated.
