          Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on "cloud" 
          services (knows as Backend as a Service) or on custom code that's run in ephemeral runtime 
          (Function as a Service or "FaaS").
        - >
          To application developers "serverless" mean app where some certain logic of it is still 
          written by the developer but unlike traditional architectures or microservices is run 
          in stateless compute runtime that are event-triggered, may only last for one invocation, 
          and fully managed by a cloud.
          Serverless helps developers to transfer responsibility of  keeping their apps up and 
          running as well as scaling out their workload capacity without involving devops/ops 
          as we got used to.
        - >  
          In this talk we will go through whole "serverless" thing: from decomposing 
          app and its logic to microservices and further to smaller bits, i.e. 
          functions to defining data flow through functions and building their fault-tolerant pipeline. 
        - >  
          <h3>Moreover, we will go through demo that highlight key takeaways:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>what is functions, what it could and could not be</li>
            <li>how design scalable architecture without getting into troubles by hitting concrete bottlenecks</li>
            <li>how combine multiple programming languages into a single app</li>
            <li>why Python is one of the best programming languages designed exactly for serverless</li>
          </ul>

          Gradient boosting machines (GBM) and related tree-based algorithms have 
          been proved to be highly effective and accurate in a wide range of machine 
          learning tasks. It is also one of the most popular algorithms among 
          participants in Kaggle competitions. This talk will introduce the basic 
          concepts of gradient boosting machines, the commonly used libraries in 
          Python such as XGBoost and LightGBM for performing machine learning 
          using GBM, and ways to tune the hyper-parameters of a model to avoid
          over/under-fitting and achieve better results. The audience are expected 
          to have basic understanding of machine learning. Codes and slides will 
          be provided on Github after the talk.

  -   title:  How to reinvent the wheel and build the most popular JSON-RPC library

          This topic covers 4 years journey of JSON-RPC library implementation. While 
          there were several similar projects, the author decided to write another one. 
          Why reinvent the wheel?
        - >
          Now the library is the most popular Python implementation of JSON-RPC protocol. 
          Kirill wants to share his ideas behind package architecture, positioning, 
          and promotion.
